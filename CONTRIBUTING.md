To contribute and keep things organized i just ask you to do the following:
- Fork the project
- Raise a new issue if that is the case
- Create a new branch for the issue/feature against the current long lived branch for the next release
- Push to the branch
- Create a new pull request comparing your new branch with the current long lived branch as base and tag it appropriately
